This C++ project allows for numerous sorting algorithms to be visualised (by sorting a list of randomly generated numbers).  
  
The controls for this project is as follows:  
-Escape - Exit program  
-Up arrow - Increase algorithm speed  
-Down arrow - Decrease algorithm speed (minimum is 1)  
-Left arrow - Decrease the number of items to be sorted (minimum is 2 and can only be changed when no sorting algorithm is running)  
-Right arrow - Increase the number of items to be sorted (maximum is 1920)  
-Enter - Execute currently selected algorithm  
-Backspace - Pause current algorithm (if running)  
-R - Stops the currently running algorithm (if applicable) and creates a new random list of numbers  
-1 - Select Bubble Sort  
-2 - Select Shuttle Sort  
-3 - Select Cocktail Shaker Sort  
-4 - Select Merge Sort  
-5 - Select Quick Sort  
-6 - Select Radix Sort  
-7 - Select Bogo Sort
